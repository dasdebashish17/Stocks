code for stock analysis and trading

currently the analysis has been done using daily chart. Though this is good, weekly chart can provide a better insight about the stock price.

stocks can be sorted alphabetically before processing.

stocks history data can be processed to categorise stocks into stable and unstable stocks with appropriate ranking. stocks which show lesser variation are better and have less risk of depleting in value compared to those with larger fluctuations.
